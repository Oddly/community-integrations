# Elastic community integrations

<em>Creating integrations so you don't have to</em>
</div>

# Introduction

This project aims to provide the integrations Elastic doesn't (yet) provide. Instead of building your own ingest pipelines and templates, our aim is to provide Elastic packages that can easily be used by anyone.

Be advised that this project is not supported by Elastic. We try to be meticulous, but mistakes are possible.
If you want to see something added, feel free to open an issue, if you want to see change happen quickly, consider helping out. PR's are welcome!
